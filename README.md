A very lightweight and basic node application equipped with Babel for Node. WebPack is not included in this setup because the Babel part in this minimal setup focuses
only on the backend. You can always add WebPack anytime you want if you want to transpile both backend and frontend and bundle everything at the same time. You can check
my Robust Node Scaffolding git repo [here](https://github.com/MelodicCrypter/Robust-Node-Scaffolding) for a more sophisticated setup.
